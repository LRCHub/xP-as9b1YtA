Bitten nails handfuls of hair
Head in her hands sat on the stairs
Bitter tears locked up inside
Figting her heart figting her mind

It's merry go round
You can never get off
It's merry go round
It will never stop

What is she wife keeper or friend
She has no more give or lend
And someone said
"What is full of care
We have no time to stand and stare"

It's merry go round
You can never get off
It's merry go round
It will never stop

She has to break away
She wants to leave
Now she has made her own bed
But she can't sleep

It's merry go round
You can never get off
It's merry go round
It will never stop
